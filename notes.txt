# Option A: Console app that I call from web page passing args.
# Option B: new app integrated into Django   <------ BEST OPTION (also hardest)
# Option C: write code directly in the site repo

Ideas:
Toggle On/Off buttons
Slider for brightness
Temp chooser
Color chooser ?


Time of day sync
Click to enable it. It sets the Temp and Brightness based on time of day


Weather-sync
Get weather type ("Cloudy") and time-of-day and set light Color+Brightness
This can be a button on the site 'Weather Sync' that applies it
The button should put the system into weather_sync mode, that automatically updates itself every minute
